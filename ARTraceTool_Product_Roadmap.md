# ARTraceTool – Product Roadmap & Feature Requirements

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Core App Features (DaVinci Eye Base)

### ✅ Must-Have Features

#### **AR Tracing**
- Overlay a reference image onto real paper using the phone camera (augmented reality).
- Adjustable opacity, zoom, and rotation for the overlay image.
- **Strobe mode:** Flicker the overlay image on/off to help compare drawing and reference.

#### **Drawing Tracker**
- Detect pen/pencil movements and drawing progress.
- Use optical flow or edge detection to distinguish hand from paper.
- Show “ghost” outlines or guide layers to assist tracing.

#### **Image Filters for Drawing**
- **Line art converter:** Convert images to line art using edge detection.
- **Shading filters:** Apply hatching, crosshatch, or grayscale block effects to assist with shading.

#### **Guided Drawing Tools**
- **Grid overlay:** Add a grid to both the reference and live view for proportion accuracy.
- **Cross-section breakdown:** Divide the image into sections for easier drawing.
- **Step-by-step mode:** Gradually reveal parts of the image for guided drawing.
- **Onion skin mode:** Show progress layers to track drawing development.

#### **Timelapse Recording**
- Record the user’s drawing process, optionally including the tracing overlay.

## 🤖 Phase 2: AI-Powered Features

### 🎨 Smart Filters
- Use AI models to:
  - Auto-generate simplified line drawings from photos.
  - Suggest shading or stroke directions based on lighting.
  - Convert images to different artistic styles.

### 🧠 Skill-Based Assistance
- AI detects user’s sketch progress and provides prompts:
  - “Add more shading here.”
  - “Line looks off-center — would you like to see a reference guide?”

### ✏️ AI Trace Simplifier
- Upload a complex photo and have AI break it into:
  - Basic outline
  - Mid-tone shading
  - Final texture pass

## 🌍 Phase 3: Community Contribution

### 👥 Artist-Contributed Templates
- Allow users to upload:
  - Their own reference photos
  - Processed line art
  - Drawing walkthroughs/tutorials
- **Gamification:**
  - Likes/upvotes
  - Featured artist of the week
  - Community challenges (e.g., “draw this cat”)

### 📚 Collaborative Learning Hub
- Users can post:
  - Step-by-step process drawings
  - Custom AR tracing packs (e.g., “Learn to draw faces in 5 steps”)
